#### About 💬

- Hi there 👋, my name is **Kaiz Khatri**. I'm a full-time `opensource` ninja and I create cursor themes. Currently, I'm creating **Themes Engine** to automate the theme generating workflow.
- I learned a lot from the Dev Community & GitHub in the last two years.
- So today I'm sharing my all experience with this **piece of software**.
- I hope you enjoyed `#actionshackathon` as much as **I did**.

## My workflow ⚡

### What is TheActionDev 🧑‍💻 ?

**TheActionDev** is Github Action that allows you to write & maintain [dev.to](https://dev.to/) **articles** without touching the `dev.to` UI. This action is initiated in **[#ActionsHackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-github-actions-hackathon-on-dev-3ljn)** and is using **[DEV API](https://docs.dev.to/api/)**. This action is scan your **Github Repository** based on `directory` [input](#inputs) and finds articles based on the **[Jekyll front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)** in `markdown` files.

### Benefits :

- **Version Control** for dev.to articles ⚡
- Time travel 🚀
- Collaborate with other people 🤗
- Reduce one tab of your web browser 😱
